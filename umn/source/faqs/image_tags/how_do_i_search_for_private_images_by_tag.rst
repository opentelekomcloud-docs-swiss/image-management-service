How Do I Search for Private Images by Tag?
==========================================

.. note::

   When adding predefined tags to an image or searching for an image using predefined tags, you must have permission to access the Tag Management Service (TMS).

#. Access the IMS console.

   a. Log in to the management console.

   b. Under **Compute**, click **Image Management Service**.

      The IMS console is displayed.

#. Click the **Private Images** tab and then **Search by Tag**.

#. Enter the tag key and value.

   Neither the tag key nor tag value can be empty. When the tag key and tag value are matched, the system automatically shows your desired private images.

#. Click |image1| to add a tag.

   You can add multiple tags to search for private images. The system will display private images that match all tags.

#. Click **Search**.

   The system searches for private images based on tag keys or tag values.
