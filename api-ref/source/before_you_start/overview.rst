Overview
========

Welcome to *Image Management Service API Reference*. An image is a template used to create a server or disk. Image Management Service (IMS) provides image lifecycle management. You can use a server or an external image file to create a system or data disk image, or use an Elastic Cloud Server (ECS) or Cloud Backup and Recovery (CBR) backup to create a full-ECS image.

This document describes how to use application programming interfaces (APIs) to perform operations on images, such as creating, querying, deleting and updating images. For details about all supported operations, see :ref:`API Overview <en-us_topic_0121588224>`.

If you plan to access IMS through an API, ensure that you are familiar with IMS concepts. For details, see section "Overview" in *Image Management Service User Guide*.
